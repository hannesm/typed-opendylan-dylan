//  This file contains definitions for sorting utilities for Dylan
//  sequences.
//
//  These are the default methods for sorting sequences.  The way they work
//  is to coerce the sequence to be sorted to a vector.  This allows easier
//  access to the elements of the sequence and the use of typical sorting
//  algorithms.  When the sorting is complete, the vector is coerced back
//  to the class for copy of the original sequence.
//
//  A simple insertion sort is defined first.  This algorithm works well for
//  small sequences, but is too inefficient for large tasks.  Two more
//  efficient algorithms are also implemented: merge sort and quick sort.
//  The more efficient sorts can use the simple sorting algorithm for
//  small subsequences.  (This is controlled by the $SMALL-SORT-SIZE
//  constant.)
//
//  One common feature of the sort functions which sort in place is the
//  keyword arguments START and END.  These keywords tell the sort function
//  which portion of the vector to operate upon.  Thus recursive calls or
//  calls to other sort functions can sort different segments of the same
//  vector through use of keys.  The START key is always an inclusive bound
//  for the beginning of the subsequence; the END key is always an
//  exclusive bound for the end of the subsequence.

//// Recursive Sorting Algorithms

// $small-sort-size -- internal
//
// The simple sorts can be used to sort the small subsequences generated
// by the recursive algorithms.  This parameter defines how small the
// subsequence should be before the simple sorts are called.  (The simple
// sorts can be turned off by setting this to 0.)
//

// Merge Sort
//
// Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm.  It divides the vector in
// half and recursively calls merge sort on the halves.  When the calls
// return, the halves are sorted, and they are merged together.
//
// Merge sort is stable.  There is a version that sorts in place, and
// modifies the original vector.  This uses a small amount of extra space
// in the process (it merges the sorted halves into a new vector and then
// copies back to the original).  There is also a version that uses as
// much extra space as it needs, and sorts non-destructively.

// merge! -- internal
//
// This function merges two contiguous sorted subsequences of a vector.
// It accepts four keyword arguments in addition to a vector.  TEST
// specifies the ascending order for the sort/merge.  START and MIDDLE
// give the beginnings of the two subsequences, and END is the end of the
// second subsequence.  (Again, START and MIDDLE are inclusive bounds for
// the subsequences, and MIDDLE and END are exclusive end bounds.  (The
// subsequences must be contiguous in the vector.))
//
// Again, merging assumes the subsequences are sorted.  Two pointers run
// down each subsequence.  The smallest of the two elements is copied to a
// merge vector and the pointer for its subsequence is incremented.  This
// continues until both pointers reach the end of the subsequences.
// Finally the merge vector is copied into the original vector in place.
