// A number of collection functions can take multiple collections as 
// arguments.  Efficiently iterating over multiple collections in parallel
// requires some care, and a non-trivial amount of code.  Rather than making
// this code purely internal to the collections functions,  we define a set of
// classes for dealing with multiple collections.  The result will be slightly
// less efficient than the dedicated versions, but we then have the option of 
// making the classes visible to the user if we want.  


// The basic idea is to take a sequence of collections and to build a 
// collection from them.  Iterating through this collection will iterate 
// through it's constituent collections in parallel.  There are three
// separate cases to consider, depending on whether the constituents are all
// sequences, explicit keyed collections, or a mixture.

// In the multiple sequence case we just store the sequences.

define class <multiple-sequence>(<sequence>)
  constant slot collections :: limited(<vector>, of: <sequence>),
         required-init-keyword: collections:;

// In the explicit key case we cache the index of the smallest collection,
// but delay computing it until needed in case some of the collections have
// slow size methods.

define class <multiple-explicit-key-collection>(<explicit-key-collection>)
  constant slot collections :: limited(<vector>, of: <explicit-key-collection>), 
         required-init-keyword: collections:;
  slot smallest-collection-index :: false-or(<integer>) = #f;
end class <multiple-explicit-key-collection>;

// In the mixed case we separate the sequence collections from the rest.  This
// is so we can iterate through the sequences whilst performing random access
// on the other collections.  However, we need to record the position of each
// collection in the original sequence, and we use a couple of maps for this
// purpose. We also cache an upper bound on the largest key in the resulting
// collection.

// ITERATION PROTOCOL
//

// We must define a forward-iteration-protocol for each of the multiple
// collections.  First we treat the easiest case, <multiple-sequence>.

// We just need to iterate through each sequence in parallel, stopping as
// soon as one of them is exhausted.   The current-element method returns a
// vector containing the current element of each constituent sequence.  

// The state of the iteration is just the vector of constituent states, and we
// use closures to access the elements vector and iteration protocols of the
// constituents.  This assumes that creating closures will be fast in the 
// run-time, and that we don't need to inline the iteration methods in this
// case.  If this assumption turns out to be false we can include these items
// as additional components of the state.
