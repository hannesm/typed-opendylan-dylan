// we can allocate either of them as weak, in order to implement weak
// tables.  (The most recent design for weakness from the mm group would
// provide us with a mechanism for specifying when allocating an object
// that either all references within it are normal or they are all weak.)

// The type for the key vector might eventually change.  It would be nice
// if we could compute a limited <simple-vector> type from the specializers
// for the test function (or from some other mechanism) and make use of that
// to limit the element type, but it's not clear that this could really be
// done in a reasonable way.  Even if we could do that, it would add some
// additional complications because we would not be able to use special
// markers in the key vector to indicate empty or deleted, and would instead
// have to use some other mechanism which might introduce difficult threads
// issuses.  Also note that we don't need to do bounds checking when
// accessing the elements of the entry-key vector.

//
// That prevention could be implemented by noticing that the additions or
// deletions counters had changed between the time of the lookup and the
// installation, but that would add overhead to the much more common case
// where no such problem exists.  Instead, by avoiding the reuse of deleted

//
// Iteration states are not thread safe.  Attempting to use the same
// iteration state simultaneously in different threads has undefined
// consequences.
//
// There is a tricky problem in the interaction between the iteration protocol
// and weak tables.  First note that weak entry removal must behave just like
// remove-key!(), i.e. set the key part to the deleted marker, leave the value
// alone, and increment the deleted counter.  Any other behavior will lead to
// problems elsewhere.  For example, removing the value could screw gethash.
//
// The problem with the iteration protocol is that entry removal could
// effectively remove the current entry out from under an iteration state.
// For weak-on-key tables, this can be addressed by having the iteration state
// include the current key, thereby ensuring that it is live if the iteration
// state is live, blocking removal of the corresponding entry.
//
// For weak-on-value tables, things are more difficult.  The problem is that
// simply making the iteration state hold onto the current value won't work
// if direct calls to element-setter on the same key are also permitted.
// However, because remove-key!() doesn't touch the value part of the entry,
// we do have a "default" value to use if the entry has been (re)moved out
// from under us.
//
// So what we do is make the current-element function check for the entry
// having been deleted, and if so it does the fully general lookup (i.e.
// gethash), using the value from the deleted entry as the default.  This
// can produce somewhat surprising results in some cases, but the data
// structure integrity is maintained and it is possible to explain these
// anomolies in terms of the state having "pre-fetched" the value.
//
// A different approach that would deal with weak tables but could still
// lead to problems with remove-key!() would be to record the existance
// of an iteration state in the vector and prohibit weak entry removal for
// any table vector that was undergoing iteration, with a termination
// method for iteration states that removed that record.  A complication
// in this scheme is that rehash would need to forward that record to the
// new vector.  Of course, this scheme also requires that termination be
// implemented.
//
// Note that we can't implement in-place rehash without some mechanism for
// inhibiting it while an active iteration state exists for the same
// table vector.  That also requires termination, so that when an iteration
// state becomes inaccessible its associated inhibition against in-place
// rehash gets removed.

// vector for the table being iterated over; a rehash may have changed the
